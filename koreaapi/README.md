# KoreaAPI

**The verifiable data layer for Korean culture & commerce, callable by any AI agent.**
*The MCP gateway to Korea — verifiable.*

KoreaAPI exposes Korean culture, entertainment, and commerce data to AI agents via
Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP). Every response carries machine-readable
**provenance** and a **Skill Score** so an agent can decide whether to trust and cite it.

> **Status:** Phase 1 (cold-start). The locked spec is in [`SCOPE.md`](./SCOPE.md).
> **Hosting:** Temporarily inside the `weatherplan-ai` repo under `koreaapi/`; to be
> moved to its own repository later.

## Why this exists
Raw Korean API wrappers are a commodity (20+ already exist on GitHub). Our moat is the
combination nobody else ships:

- **Aggregation** of fragmented K-culture / commerce sources
- **Verification** — Skill Score + provenance, exactly where LLMs confidently hallucinate
- **Append-only time-series** — a latecomer cannot reconstruct our history
- **Behavioral signal** — what agents query / buy through us becomes trend data

The customer is the **AI agent** (consumer); humans / brands / enterprises pay.

## Revenue flywheel (engines ① + ②)
K-culture current-state is the magnet. ① commerce commission + ② trend-intelligence
subscription reinforce each other: transactions generate the behavioral signal that
becomes the trend product, which improves commerce conversion. See [`SCOPE.md`](./SCOPE.md) §3.

## The heart: append-only ingestion (component A)
```
fetch → LLM-extract → cross-verify → bilingual-normalize → append (+ Skill Score)
```
**Overwrite = wrapper. Append timestamped snapshots = an asset.**

## Bilingual by design
Korean = canonical (provenance anchor). English = distribution layer.
Names carry `ko` / `en_official` / `romanized`. See [`SCOPE.md`](./SCOPE.md) §5.

cd koreaapi
uv sync
# pipeline entry points are scaffolded stubs — Phase 1 wiring in progress
uv run python -c "import koreaapi; print(koreaapi.__version__)"
