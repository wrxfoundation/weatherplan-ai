"""The artist roster - entity_id -> canonical name (the live-resolution search term).

These are NOT Q-ids. Q-ids are resolved LIVE on the open network (GitHub runners) via
wbsearchentities / Wikipedia and cross-verified, never hardcoded unverified - that is exactly
how a wrong id ("Q484203 = Arborka") slipped in before. The fetched name is then identity-
checked against this canonical name, so a wrong search resolution is rejected by graceful
degradation, never ingested.

Keep names DISTINCTIVE (low search-collision); a name that also matches an unrelated entity
could pass the name guard. The 3 hottest acts also have verified Q-ids in
sources/wikidata.py `_CURATED` (fast path + bilingual guard).
