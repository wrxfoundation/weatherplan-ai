"""KoreaAPI MCP server (agent face) - thin FastMCP binding over service.py.

The logic lives in service.py (pure, offline-testable). This module only binds it to
the Model Context Protocol so any AI agent can call it. Every response carries
provenance + Skill Score (invariant 2).

Run (stdio):  PYTHONPATH=src python -m koreaapi.server
Requires fastmcp at runtime:  pip install fastmcp   (use a venv if system deps clash)
